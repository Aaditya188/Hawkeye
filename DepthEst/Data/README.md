# Dataset 
##  The Kitti Vision Benchmark Suite
A novel dataset captured from a VW station wagon for use in mobile robotics and autonomous driving research. The scenarios are captured with high- resolution color and grayscale stereo cameras, a Velodyne 3D laser scanner and a high-precision GPS/IMU inertial navigation system and contains diverse  real-world traffic situations and ranging from freeways over rural areas to inner- city scenes with many static and dynamic objects. 

## How to Use The Data
For our purpose, we'll be using data from the stereo cameras only. Go to this [link](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php?type=campus) , and download the zip file from any category.
